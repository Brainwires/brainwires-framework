## [Unreleased]

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed

#### `brainwires-reasoning` restored as Layer 3 owner (BREAKING)

The 0.9.0 `brainwires-reasoning` crate shipped as a 22-line re-export shell.
The 0.8 → 0.9 refactor split the intended content across two other crates:
the plan/output parsers stayed in `brainwires-core` behind a `planning`
feature, and the 9 local-inference scorers were tucked into
`brainwires-agents::reasoning` behind a feature. The original architectural
plan (PR 7 in the 0.9 refactor series) specified these move into
`brainwires-reasoning`; the move did not happen.

0.10.0 completes it. `brainwires-reasoning` now owns, as real modules:

- `plan_parser` and `output_parser` (moved from `brainwires-core`),
- `complexity`, `entity_enhancer`, `relevance_scorer`,
  `retrieval_classifier`, `router`, `strategies`, `strategy_selector`,
  `summarizer`, `validator` (moved from `brainwires-agents::reasoning`).

Backward-compatibility: `brainwires-agents` still exposes
`brainwires_agents::reasoning::…` under its `reasoning` feature — it now
simply re-exports `brainwires_reasoning`. No changes needed for callers
using that path.

**Breaking:** callers importing directly from `brainwires_core` must
update.

| 0.9.0 path | 0.10.0 path |
|---|---|
| `brainwires_core::plan_parser::{parse_plan_steps, steps_to_tasks, ParsedStep}` | `brainwires_reasoning::plan_parser::…` (also re-exported at crate root) |
| `brainwires_core::output_parser::{JsonOutputParser, JsonListParser, OutputParser, RegexOutputParser}` | `brainwires_reasoning::output_parser::…` (also re-exported at crate root) |
| `brainwires_core/planning` feature | feature removed — pull `brainwires-reasoning` directly |
| `brainwires_core/native` feature | kept as an empty stub for downstream compatibility |

### Added

#### Tools — bash sandbox + byte caps (`brainwires-tools`)

- **`BashSandboxMode::NetworkDeny`** — wraps every `execute_command` in
  `unshare -U -r -n -- bash -o pipefail -c …` on Linux, denying outbound
  network via a new user + network namespace without requiring root. Silent
  no-op on non-Linux with a warning surfaced in the tool result so the
  model knows sandboxing was not enforced.
- **Opt-in from env or CLI** — `BRAINWIRES_BASH_SANDBOX=network-deny`
  (also `networkdeny`, `1`, `on`) or the new `brainwires chat --sandbox
  network-deny` CLI flag. `Off` is the default; `from_env()` is read at
  command-build time, so every bash tool call goes through the same
  policy gate regardless of invocation path.
- **Per-stream 25KB byte cap** — `MAX_STREAM_BYTES = 25_000`. Stdout and
  stderr are each middle-truncated with a `… [N bytes truncated] …`
  marker, preserving head + tail and respecting UTF-8 boundaries. Guards
  against a single runaway line (binary blob, `cat` on a huge log)
  blowing past context limits regardless of line-based `output_mode`.

#### Providers — Anthropic prompt caching + image blocks
(`brainwires-providers`)

- **Prompt caching enabled by default** — `cache_prompt: true` on both
  `messages` (single-shot) and streaming requests. `cache_read` and
  `cache_creation` token counts are logged (`tracing::info!` on cache
  hits, `tracing::debug!` on writes) so operators can verify
  cache-hit-rate in production.
- **`ContentBlock::Image` (Base64) → Anthropic image envelope** — the
  Anthropic chat provider now converts core `ImageSource::Base64
  { media_type, data }` blocks into native Anthropic
  `image` content blocks. Unblocks multimodal user messages; added a
  dedicated roundtrip test.

#### CLI — dream, sandbox, tool curation, monitor, shell overlay, and more
(`brainwires-cli`)

- **Dream (sleep) consolidation** — new `/dream`, `/dream:status`,
  `/dream:run` slash commands. The framework's
  `brainwires::dream::DreamConsolidator` does the work; the CLI supplies
  an `InMemoryDreamSessionStore` adapter that feeds the active
  conversation into the consolidator and surfaces a before/after token
  report. Manual on-demand today; a tokio-interval scheduler can sit on
  top later without changing this API.
- **`--sandbox=network-deny`** — top-level CLI flag that sets
  `BRAINWIRES_BASH_SANDBOX` once at startup (pre-thread-spawn) so the
  bash tool's env read is race-free.
- **`--all-tools`** — opt-in eager enumeration of every registered
  tool. Non-TUI chat paths default to the curated core set (14 tools
  including `search_tools`) in canonical order — smaller outbound
  request body and a stable prefix for Anthropic prompt caching.
- **Monitor tool** — background process watcher that streams stdout
  events as notifications; filter-first design so a single noisy log
  doesn't flood the conversation.
- **`/shell` interactive overlay** — full terminal subshell overlay
  inside the TUI.
- **Remappable global keybindings** — `~/.claude/keybindings.json`
  drives chord and single-key rebinding for all global TUI shortcuts.
- **Harness parity** — settings, hooks, memory, ask-user-question,
  monitor polish; TUI skill autocomplete; custom status line;
  auto-loading of `CLAUDE.md` / `BRAINWIRES.md` from cwd upward;
  `--provider` first-run picker; worktree primitive; skill
  `allowed_tools` + execution-mode honouring in `/skill`; 2 456-line
  `command_handler.rs` split into topic submodules.

#### Tests — proptest + 92 new tests

`proptest` added as a workspace dev-dependency. 92 new tests land across
five new integration-test files:

- **`brainwires-permissions` (44 tests, 4 files)** —
  `tests/policy_matching.rs` (23 tests: every `PolicyCondition` variant
  incl. And/Or/Not composition, priority ordering, default-action
  fallback, disabled-policy skipping, `with_defaults()` preset);
  `tests/wildcard_domains.rs` (5 proptests guarding
  `*.example.com` suffix/prefix-confusion bypasses);
  `tests/audit_durability.rs` (8 tests covering important-event
  immediate-write, buffer-flush ordering, JSONL replay from a prior
  session, disabled-logger silence); `tests/anomaly_thresholds.rs`
  (8 tests pinning the sliding-window threshold boundary, per-agent
  isolation, out-of-window forgetting, path-scope allowlist).
- **`brainwires-mcp` (15 tests, 1 file)** — `tests/jsonrpc_roundtrip.rs`:
  string/integer/null id roundtrips, response-error wire shape,
  notification id-absence contract, progress-notification parsing,
  unknown-method fallthrough, malformed-JSON rejection, transport
  discriminator on explicit null id, five proptest roundtrips for
  Request/Response-success/Response-error/Notification/ProgressParams.
- **`brainwires-reasoning` (25 tests, 1 file)** —
  `tests/parser_properties.rs`: numbered + bulleted + `Step N:` plan
  formats, priority-keyword detection, indent→substep mapping,
  steps-to-tasks invariants, JSON extraction from markdown fences with
  and without language tags and from surrounding prose, regex-parser
  named-capture extraction and invalid-pattern rejection, five
  proptests including panic-freeness on arbitrary text and embedded-
  object extraction.
- **`brainwires-tools` (7 tests, 1 file)** —
  `tests/path_resolution.rs`: relative-vs-absolute anchoring,
  nonexistent-path fallback, nested paths, documented-and-pinned
  current non-sandbox `..` traversal behaviour, two proptests covering
  arbitrary UTF-8 input and unicode-named paths.
- **`brainwires` metacrate (1 test, 1 file)** —
  `tests/reexports.rs`: compile-time smoke for the feature-gated
  re-export surface (core, tools, agents, permissions, reasoning,
  storage, mcp).

### Fixed

- **`brainwires-providers`** — unreachable catch-arm removed from the
  Anthropic content-block conversion; any future `ContentBlock` variant
  now fails loudly at compile time instead of being silently filtered.

### Documentation

- **`TESTING.md`** — corrected every `brainwires-eval` reference. The
  eval framework lives at `brainwires_agents::eval` (feature-gated
  module on `brainwires-agents`), not a standalone
  `brainwires-eval` crate. §8 now notes the empirical-scoring suite
  targets `brainwires_reasoning::ComplexityScorer` after the 0.10
  restoration.
- **`brainwires-hardware`** — Matter implementation marked experimental
  with a documented list of spec-compliance gaps.

### Publish tooling

- **`scripts/publish.sh --preflight-only`** — fast manifest checks
  (README present, no git-only deps without version, metadata set) for
  every publishable crate. Runs in seconds without spending
  `cargo publish --dry-run` time budget.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-13

### Added

#### `matter-tool` — Brainwires-native Matter CLI (`extras/matter-tool`)

- **New `matter-tool` binary** — first-party CLI equivalent of `chip-tool` built entirely on the Brainwires pure-Rust Matter 1.3 stack. No `connectedhomeip` dependency; compiles in seconds.
- **`pair` subcommand** — commission devices via QR code (`pair qr <node-id> <MT:…>`), 11-digit manual pairing code (`pair code`), or BLE (`pair ble`, requires `--features ble`). `pair unpair <node-id>` removes a device from the local fabric.
- **Cluster control commands** — `onoff {on,off,toggle,read}`, `level {set,read}`, `thermostat {setpoint,read}`, `doorlock {lock,unlock,read}`. Each takes `<node-id> <endpoint>`.
- **`invoke`** — send a raw cluster command: `invoke <node-id> <endpoint> <cluster-hex> <cmd-hex> [payload-hex]`.
- **`read`** — read a raw cluster attribute: `read <node-id> <endpoint> <cluster-hex> <attr-hex>`.
- **`discover`** — browse `_matterc._udp` (commissionable) and `_matter._tcp` (operational) via mDNS, print found devices with addresses and TXT records. `--timeout <secs>` (default 5).
- **`serve`** — run as a Matter device server (commission us from another controller). Prints QR code and pairing code on startup. Flags: `--device-name`, `--vendor-id`, `--product-id`, `--discriminator`, `--passcode`, `--port`, `--storage`.
- **`devices`** — list all commissioned devices in the local fabric.
- **`fabric info`** — print fabric directory and commissioned node count. **`fabric reset`** — wipe fabric storage (interactive `yes` confirmation required).
- **Global flags** — `--fabric-dir <DIR>` (default `~/.local/share/matter-tool/` on Linux), `--verbose` / `-v`, `--json` (machine-readable output for all commands).
- **`ble` feature** — BLE commissioning path via `brainwires-hardware/matter-ble`; excluded from the default build.

#### GitHub Channel Adapter (`extras/brainclaw/mcp-github`)

- **New `brainclaw-mcp-github` crate** — full GitHub channel adapter for the Brainwires gateway. Receives GitHub webhook events and exposes GitHub operations as an MCP tool server.
- **Webhook receiver** — Axum HTTP server with HMAC-SHA256 signature verification (`X-Hub-Signature-256`). Normalises `issue_comment`, `issues`, `pull_request`, and `pull_request_review_comment` events into `ChannelMessage` values.
- **`GitHubChannel`** — implements the `Channel` trait against the GitHub REST API: post/edit/delete comments, list issue comments, add reactions (with Unicode emoji → GitHub reaction name mapping), retrieve issue history.
- **MCP tool server** — 10 tools via rmcp `tool_router` macros: `post_comment`, `edit_comment`, `delete_comment`, `get_comments`, `create_issue`, `close_issue`, `add_labels`, `create_pull_request`, `merge_pull_request`, `add_reaction`. Runs over stdio alongside the gateway client.
- **Gateway client** — mirrors the `mcp-discord` gateway client pattern: `ChannelHandshake { channel_type: "github" }`, bidirectional `ChannelEvent` ↔ gateway WebSocket forwarding.
- **Config** — env-var driven: `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, `WEBHOOK_ADDR` (default `0.0.0.0:9000`), `GATEWAY_URL`, `GATEWAY_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_REPOS` (comma-separated allowlist), `GITHUB_API_URL`.
- **CLI** — `serve` and `version` subcommands via Clap. `--mcp` flag enables the MCP stdio server alongside the gateway client.
- **Tests** — HMAC-SHA256 signature verification, `normalise()` for all four event types, `GitHubChannel` conversation/message-ID parsing, reaction emoji mapping.

#### Multi-Turn Conversation History (`extras/voice-assistant`)

- **`LlmHandler` history** — added `history: Mutex<Vec<OpenAIMessage>>` to `LlmHandler`. Each completed STT→LLM turn appends the user message and assistant reply; the system prompt is prepended fresh on every request. The assistant can now reference earlier turns within a session. `clear_history()` provided for explicit reset.

#### New Examples

- **`brainwires-mcp-server/examples/hello_world_server.rs`** — minimal runnable stdio MCP server with `echo` and `greet` tools. Demonstrates `McpServer`, `McpToolRegistry::dispatch`, `Content::text`, and `LoggingMiddleware`. Can be exercised with raw JSON-RPC on stdin.
- **`brainwires-channels/examples/mock_channel.rs`** — reference `Channel` trait implementation backed by an in-memory `HashMap`. Exercises all six trait methods (`send_message`, `edit_message`, `delete_message`, `add_reaction`, `get_history`, `set_presence`). Serves as the blueprint for real channel adapters.
- **`brainwires-analytics/examples/track_agent_run.rs`** — end-to-end demo of `AnalyticsCollector` + `MemoryAnalyticsSink`. Records `ProviderCall`, `ToolCall`, and `AgentRun` events, calls `flush()`, then snapshots the sink to verify event counts and cost tallies.

#### Full Matter 1.3 Protocol Stack (`brainwires-hardware`)

- **SPAKE2+ Augmented PAKE** (RFC 9383) — pure Rust implementation using RustCrypto p256, implemented from scratch due to the absence of a production-ready SPAKE2+ crate. Prover + Verifier roles, PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 passcode derivation, HMAC-SHA256 confirmation (cA/cB).
- **PASE** (Password-Authenticated Session Establishment) — full commissioning handshake: PBKDFParamRequest/Response, Pake1/2/3, session key derivation (I2RKey, R2IKey, AttestationChallenge via HKDF-SHA256).
- **CASE** (Certificate-Authenticated Session Establishment) — SIGMA protocol: Sigma1/2/3 exchange, P-256 ephemeral ECDH, AES-CCM-128 encrypted payloads, NOC chain verification.
- **Matter compact certificate format** — TLV-encoded NOC/ICAC/RCAC encode/decode per Matter spec §6.4, P-256 ECDSA-SHA256 signatures, Matter OIDs for NodeId/FabricId.
- **Fabric management** — `FabricManager` with root CA generation, NOC issuance, JSON persistence, multi-fabric bookkeeping.
- **Matter transport layer** — Message Layer header encode/decode (Matter spec §4.4), MRP (Message Reliability Protocol) with configurable retry/backoff (Matter spec §4.12), AES-CCM-128 UDP session encryption.
- **Interaction Model** — `ReadRequest`/`ReportData`, `WriteRequest`/`WriteResponse`, `InvokeRequest`/`InvokeResponse`, `SubscribeRequest`/`SubscribeResponse` with full TLV encode/decode and wildcard `AttributePath`/`CommandPath`.
- **Mandatory commissioning clusters** — `BasicInformation` (0x0028), `GeneralCommissioning` (0x0030), `OperationalCredentials` (0x003E), `NetworkCommissioning` (0x0031).
- **`MatterDeviceServer`** — fully functional device server: PASE commissioning window, CASE operational sessions, IM cluster dispatch, `CommissionableAdvertiser` mDNS (`_matterc._udp`).
- **`MatterController`** — fully functional controller: mDNS device discovery, PASE commissioning, CASE session management, cluster invoke/read, session caching.
- **BLE commissioning** (`matter-ble` feature) — BTP transport protocol (Matter spec §4.17): handshake, segmentation/reassembly, fragmentation. `MatterBlePeripheral` with Matter BLE service UUID, Linux/macOS btleplug peripheral support.
- **`OperationalAdvertiser`/`OperationalBrowser`** — post-commissioning `_matter._tcp` DNS-SD with CompressedFabricId derivation.
- **New workspace deps** — `p256 0.13.2`, `ecdsa 0.16.9`, `hmac 0.12`, `hkdf 0.12`, `pbkdf2 0.12.2`, `aes 0.8.4`, `ccm 0.5.0`, `der 0.8.0`, `pkcs8 0.10.2`.
- **New features** — `matter-ble` (BLE commissioning), `homeauto-full` (all protocols including BLE).
- **80 unit tests** — all pure logic, no hardware required. Integration test `matter_e2e` available with `--include-ignored`.

#### Home Automation Protocols (`brainwires-hardware`)

- **`homeauto` module** — New `src/homeauto/` module group behind four feature flags: `zigbee`, `zwave`, `thread`, `matter` (or all via `homeauto`). Each sub-module is independent; pull in only what you need.
- **Shared types** — `HomeDevice`, `HomeAutoEvent`, `Capability`, `AttributeValue`, `Protocol` enum used across all four protocols. `BoxStream<'a, T>` alias for async event streams.
- **`zigbee` feature** — Full Zigbee 3.0 coordinator support via raw serial, two backends:
  - `EzspCoordinator` — Silicon Labs EZSP v8 over ASH framing (CRC-16-CCITT poly=0x1021, byte-stuffing 0x7E/0x7D, ACK/NAK/RST flow control). Targets EmberZNet 7.x / EFR32-based sticks (Sonoff Zigbee 3.0 USB Dongle Plus, Aeotec USB 7).
  - `ZnpCoordinator` — TI Z-Stack 3.x ZNP protocol (SREQ/SRSP/AREQ frames with XOR FCS). Targets CC2652, CC2531, and Z-Stack-based dongles.
  - `ZigbeeCoordinator` trait — `start`, `stop`, `permit_join`, `devices`, `read_attribute`, `write_attribute`, `invoke_command`, `events` stream.
  - Standard cluster helpers in `zigbee::clusters`: on/off, level, color temperature, color RGB, temperature sensor, humidity, door lock.
- **`zwave` feature** — Full Z-Wave Plus v2 (specification 7.x / ZAPI2) over USB stick serial port. `ZWaveController` trait with `ZWaveSerialController` implementation. Supports node inclusion/exclusion, 27-variant `CommandClass` enum (BinarySwitch, MultilevelSwitch, Thermostat, DoorLock, SensorMultilevel, Configuration, and more), ACK/NAK/CAN flow control, XOR checksum, 3-retry retransmit on timeout.
- **`thread` feature** — `ThreadBorderRouter` client for the OpenThread Border Router (OTBR) REST API (Thread 1.3.0, default port 8081). Network node info, neighbor table, active/pending dataset retrieval, joiner commissioning. Uses the existing `reqwest` workspace dep — no new heavy dependencies.
- **`matter` feature** — Matter 1.3 support via a purpose-built pure-Rust stack (avoids `rs-matter` due to an `embassy-time` links conflict with the `burn` ML ecosystem):
  - `MatterController` — Commissioner and cluster client. Supports QR-code (`MT:...`) and manual-pairing-code commissioning with full bit-packed Base38 payload parsing. Convenience helpers for OnOff, LevelControl, ColorControl, Thermostat, DoorLock, WindowCovering.
  - `MatterDeviceServer` — Expose Brainwires agents as Matter devices. Commissionable mDNS advertisement (`_matterc._udp`) via `mdns-sd`, UDP transport on port 5540, per-cluster callback handlers (on/off, level, color temp, thermostat). PASE/CASE session establishment is scaffolded with TODO markers pending upstream conflict resolution.
  - `CommissioningPayload` parser — Full Base38 decode + bit-unpack (version, VID, PID, discriminator, passcode, commissioning flow, rendezvous info). Manual pairing code (11-digit decimal) also supported.
  - Cluster TLV helpers — typed encoders for all major clusters using the Matter TLV wire format.
- **New workspace deps** — `tokio-serial = "5.4"`, `crc = "3"`, `mdns-sd = "0.12"`, `gethostname = "1.0"` (last two already in workspace, now also optional in hardware).
- **New examples** — `zigbee_scan`, `zwave_nodes`, `thread_info`, `matter_on_off`.
- **`full` feature** — Now includes `homeauto`.
- **71 unit tests** — All pure-logic tests (no hardware required): ASH framing + CRC-16-CCITT (verified against `b"123456789"` → 0x29B1), EZSP frame encode/decode, ZNP SREQ/SRESP/AREQ roundtrip, ZAPI frame + XOR checksum, Z-Wave CommandClass serialization, Thread OTBR responses (mocked via `wiremock`), Matter QR/manual code parsing, Matter cluster TLV encoding.

#### Claude Brain — Brainwires Context Management (`extras/claude-brain`)

- **New `claude-brain` crate** — persistent context management for Claude Code sessions via hook-based integration. Survives compaction events so critical context (decisions, facts, summaries) is never lost.
- **Hook-based architecture** — `PreCompact` saves context to persistent storage before compaction, `SessionStart` restores it on session init (routed through SessionStart instead of PostCompact for reliability).
- **Dynamic hook budget** — hook output budget computed from compaction threshold × 70%, ensuring restored context fits within available token window.
- **Settings from JSON** — reads configuration from JSON settings files; replaced magic numbers with named constants.
- **v2 structural improvements** — 10 improvements across 3 phases: better compaction loop handling, integration file sourcing from `extras/`, and `install.sh` for automated setup.

#### `brainwires-memory-service` — Mem0-Compatible Memory REST API (`extras/brainwires-memory-service`)

- **New `brainwires-memory-service` crate** — standalone REST API server providing Mem0-compatible endpoints for memory storage and retrieval, backed by the Brainwires storage layer.

#### `EmailIdentityProvider` (`brainwires-network`)

- **New `EmailIdentityProvider`** — identity provider for internet-facing agent email, enabling agents to have verifiable email-based identities for external communication.

#### Session-Level Token Budget Enforcement (`brainwires-cli`)

- **`SessionBudget`** — New type in `extras/brainwires-cli/src/types/session_budget.rs` with atomic counters (`Arc<AtomicU64>` for tokens and cost-in-microcents, `Arc<AtomicU32>` for agent count). Methods: `check_before_spawn()`, `record_run(tokens, cost_usd)`, `check_limits()`, `increment_agent_count()`.
- **`TaskAgentConfig` budget fields** — Added `max_total_tokens: Option<u64>`, `max_cost_usd: Option<f64>`, `timeout_secs: Option<u64>`, and `session_budget: Option<Arc<SessionBudget>>`. The execution loop enforces per-agent token and cost caps from provider response usage, and delegates session-level cap checks to `SessionBudget` before each spawn.

#### Infinite Context Wired into TaskAgent (`brainwires-cli`)

- **`MessageStore` initialization in `TaskAgent`** — `TaskAgent::execute()` now initializes a `MessageStore` backed by LanceDB using the same pattern as the chat loop (`PlatformPaths::conversations_db_path()` + `EmbeddingProvider` + `LanceDatabase::initialize()`). Falls back to raw conversation history if LanceDB is unavailable; never fails hard.
- **`ContextBuilder` integration** — `call_provider()` now calls `ContextBuilder::build_full_context()` with `use_gating: false` so semantic retrieval fires on every call without requiring compaction markers. This matches the always-on behavior of the chat path (`ai_processing.rs`). Task agents now benefit from the same personal knowledge injection and semantic history retrieval as chat sessions.
- **Message persistence** — Each agent turn is stored in `MessageStore` so long-running tasks accumulate retrievable history across iterations.

#### Structured Agent Roles with Tool Restrictions (`brainwires-agents`)

- **`AgentRole` enum** — New `crates/brainwires-agents/src/roles.rs` with four variants:
  - `Exploration` — read-only: `read_file`, `list_directory`, `search_code`, `glob`, `grep`, `fetch_url`, `web_search`, `context_recall`, `task_get`, `task_list`
  - `Planning` — task management + read access: `task_create`, `task_update`, `task_add_subtask`, `plan_task`, plus read tools
  - `Verification` — read + build/test: `execute_command`, `check_duplicates`, `verify_build`, `check_syntax`, plus read tools
  - `Execution` — full access (default, all tools permitted)
- **Enforcement at provider call time** — `AgentRole::filter_tools()` filters the tool list passed to the provider, not post-hoc. The model never receives tools it cannot use, reducing hallucination and wasted tokens.
- **System prompt suffix** — `AgentRole::system_prompt_suffix()` appends a role constraint reminder to the agent's system prompt.
- **`registry.filtered_view()`** — Added `filtered_view(&self, allow: &[&str]) -> Vec<Tool>` to `brainwires-tool-system` registry for building role-scoped tool lists.
- **`role: Option<AgentRole>`** added to `TaskAgentConfig`.

#### Persistent Workflow State / Crash-Safe Retry (`brainwires-core`)

- **`WorkflowCheckpoint`** — Snapshot of agent execution progress: `task_id`, `agent_id`, `step_index`, `completed_tool_ids: HashSet<String>`, `side_effects_log: Vec<SideEffectRecord>`, `updated_at`.
- **`SideEffectRecord`** — Per-tool completion record: `tool_use_id`, `tool_name`, `target: Option<String>`, `completed_at`, `reversible`.
- **`WorkflowStateStore` trait** — `save_checkpoint`, `load_checkpoint`, `mark_step_complete`, `delete_checkpoint`.
- **`FsWorkflowStateStore`** — Persists checkpoints as JSON under `~/.brainwires/workflow/{task_id}.json` using atomic write (write to `.tmp`, then `rename`). Never leaves a partially-written file.
- **`InMemoryWorkflowStateStore`** — In-memory store for tests; no filesystem I/O.
- **`TaskAgent` crash-resume** — On startup, loads any prior checkpoint and skips `tool_use_id`s already recorded as complete. Persists each successful tool call. Deletes the checkpoint on clean task completion.

#### Unified Event Schema with Trace IDs (`brainwires-core`, `brainwires-a2a`, `brainwires-agent-network`)

- **`Event` trait** — Common interface: `event_id()`, `trace_id()`, `sequence()`, `occurred_at()`, `event_type()`. Implementing is optional; prefer `EventEnvelope` at boundaries.
- **`EventEnvelope<E>`** — Generic wrapper carrying any payload with `event_id: Uuid`, `trace_id: Uuid`, `sequence: u64`, `occurred_at: DateTime<Utc>`. Implements `Event`. `map()` preserves all correlation fields. `new_trace_id()` helper for call-site clarity.
- **Trace ID propagation in `TaskAgent`** — `execute()` generates a `trace_id: Uuid::new_v4()` at startup, writes it into `AgentContext.metadata["trace_id"]`, and logs it at the `INFO` level. Every `ToolContext` built from that agent context automatically carries the trace ID, enabling correlation with `AuditEvent.metadata["trace_id"]` without struct changes.
- **A2A streaming events** — `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` and `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` gain `trace_id: Option<Uuid>` (serialized as `traceId`) and `sequence: Option<u64>`, both `skip_serializing_if = None` for wire compatibility.
- **`MessageEnvelope`** — Gains `trace_id: Option<Uuid>` field. `reply()` inherits the sender's trace ID. New `with_trace(trace_id)` builder method.

#### Framework-Level System Prompt Registry (`brainwires-agents`, `brainwires-cli`)

- **`AgentPromptKind` enum** — New `crates/brainwires-agents/src/system_prompts/mod.rs` is the authoritative inventory of every agent system prompt in the framework. Variants: `Reasoning`, `Planner`, `Judge`, `Simple`, `MdapMicroagent`. Adding a new agent type means adding a variant here first.
- **`build_agent_prompt(kind, role)` dispatcher** — Single function to build any agent system prompt. Automatically appends `AgentRole::system_prompt_suffix()` when a role is provided, removing the need for callers to handle role suffix injection manually. Replaces the manual `format!("{}{}", base, role.system_prompt_suffix())` pattern in `task_agent.rs`.
- **`MdapMicroagent` prompt** — New `mdap_microagent_prompt()` for MDAP voting agents. Instructs each microagent to reason independently, notes the vote round and peer count, and explicitly discourages anchoring on what other agents might produce.
- **Eliminated CLI duplicate** — `extras/brainwires-cli/src/agents/system_prompts.rs` was an exact copy of the framework module. Deleted; all callers now import from `brainwires::agents`.
- **CLI mode prompt registry** — New `extras/brainwires-cli/src/system_prompts/modes.rs` consolidates all interactive-mode system prompts: Edit, Ask, Plan, Batch, and the `plan_task` tool sub-agent. Prompts that were previously buried inside `agent/plan_mode.rs` and `tools/plan.rs` are now extracted here.
- **`build_ask_mode_system_prompt_with_knowledge()`** — Previously missing variant (Edit mode had knowledge injection; Ask mode did not). Now available in `modes.rs`.
- **`build_batch_mode_system_prompt()`** — New distinct Batch-mode prompt optimised for throughput: concise/consistent output, self-contained responses, no exploratory dialogue.
- **`utils/system_prompt.rs` simplified** — Reduced to a thin re-export shim pointing to `system_prompts::modes` for backward compatibility.

### Changed

#### Architecture Refactoring — 22 → 16 Framework Crates

- **Crate renames** — `brainwires-tool-system` → `brainwires-tools`, `brainwires-agent-network` → `brainwires-network`, `brainwires-cognition` → `brainwires-knowledge`. All public API paths updated accordingly.
- **Crate absorptions** — `brainwires-channels` merged into `brainwires-network`, `brainwires-skills` merged into `brainwires-agents`, `brainwires-code-interpreters` merged into `brainwires-tools`, `brainwires-datasets` merged into `brainwires-training`.
- **Moved to extras** — `brainwires-wasm` and `brainwires-autonomy` moved from `crates/` to `extras/` (no longer independently published framework crates).
- **New crate** — `brainwires-reasoning` re-exports reasoning strategies from `brainwires-core`.
- **`publish.sh` updated** — publish order reduced from 22 to 16 crates.

#### Deno/TypeScript Port — Package Renames

- **Package renames** — `@brainwires/tool-system` → `@brainwires/tools`, `@brainwires/agent-network` → `@brainwires/network`, `@brainwires/cognition` → `@brainwires/knowledge`.
- **`@brainwires/skills` merged into `@brainwires/agents`** — skill parsing, registry, routing, and execution now re-exported from the agents package.
- All internal imports, examples, and documentation updated.

#### CI Hardening

- **MSRV job** — new `msrv` CI job pins `rustup override set 1.91` and runs `cargo check --workspace`, validating the declared `rust-version` on every push.
- **Stub guard job** — new `stubs` CI job runs `cargo xtask check-stubs crates/ extras/` to fail the build if new `todo!()`/`unimplemented!()`/`FIXME` markers are introduced outside test blocks.
- **Deno check/lint/test job** — new `deno` CI job runs `deno check`, `deno lint`, and `deno test --allow-all` against the `deno/` workspace.
- **`brainwires-channels` dev-dependencies** — added `tokio` (full) and `anyhow` to `[dev-dependencies]` to support the new `mock_channel` example.

#### `xtask` — Autofix Mode

- **`--fix` flag** — `cargo xtask --fix` now auto-heals CI failures. Format issues are fixed by running `cargo fmt --all` directly; check, clippy, test, and doc failures are dispatched to Claude Code CLI (`claude -p`) with captured error output, scoped tool permissions (`Read,Edit,Glob,Grep,Bash(cargo *)`), and a turn limit. Each failed step is re-verified after the fix attempt.
- **`--max-turns <N>`** — configurable turn limit per Claude fix invocation (default: 30). Gracefully skips Claude fixes when the `claude` binary is not on PATH.

### Fixed

- **Clippy warnings** resolved across `brainwires-cli`, `matter-tool`, `brainwires-network`, `brainwires-tools`, and `brainwires-agents`.
- **CI errors from architecture refactor** — fixed broken imports, missing re-exports, and formatting issues introduced during crate consolidation.
- **v0.9.0 release cleanup** — removed stale references, fixed security metadata, and corrected test assertions.
- **A2A event initializers** — added missing `trace_id` and `sequence` fields to `TaskStatusUpdateEvent` and `TaskArtifactUpdateEvent` constructors.

### Removed

- **Stale `persistent_task_manager` comments** in `brainwires-storage/src/lib.rs` — removed phantom TODO and re-export comments referencing a module that was never implemented.
- **Absorbed crates deleted from `crates/`** — `brainwires-channels`, `brainwires-skills`, `brainwires-code-interpreters`, `brainwires-datasets` directories removed after absorption into their parent crates.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-03

### Fixed

#### Centralized FastEmbed Model Cache

- **Scattered `.fastembed_cache/` directories eliminated** — FastEmbed ONNX model files (87–759 MB each) were accumulating as `.fastembed_cache/` in whatever the working directory was at runtime, creating duplicate copies across the filesystem. Both `brainwires-storage` and `brainwires-cognition` now write to a single shared location: `~/.brainwires/cache/fastembed/`.
- **`PlatformPaths::default_fastembed_cache_path()`** (`brainwires-storage`) — New utility method returning `~/.brainwires/cache/fastembed/`, consistent with the rest of the framework's use of `~/.brainwires/`.
- **`brainwires-storage` embedding manager** — `FastEmbedManager::with_model()` now sets `options.cache_dir` (previously unset, causing the default CWD-relative cache scatter).
- **`brainwires-cognition` embedding manager** — Unified to use `PlatformPaths::default_fastembed_cache_path()` instead of the old `dirs::cache_dir().join("fastembed")` path (`~/.cache/fastembed/`), so both crates share the same model files.

Existing `.fastembed_cache/` directories in project folders are stale and can be safely deleted.

### Added

#### Magic Number Cleanup

- **Audio PCM normalization** (`brainwires-hardware`) — Bare `32768.0` literals in `vad/mod.rs` and `audio/local/whisper_stt.rs` replaced with named constant `I16_NORMALIZE_DIVISOR: f32 = 32768.0` (2^15, the i16 range divisor for [-1, 1] normalisation).
- **Orchestrator token limit** (`brainwires-cli`) — `let max_tokens = 4096` in `orchestrator.rs` replaced with module-level constant `ORCHESTRATOR_MAX_TOKENS: u32 = 4096`.
- **Model output token comment** (`brainwires-providers`) — Added clarifying comment to `brainwires_http::max_output_tokens()` match block documenting values as 2026-Q1 provider specifications.

#### A2A/ACP Protocol Compliance (`brainwires-a2a`)

- **`A2A_PROTOCOL_VERSION` constant** — `pub const A2A_PROTOCOL_VERSION: &str = "0.3"` added to crate root, targeting the A2A 0.3 spec (post-ACP merger under AAIF/Linux Foundation, December 2025). `AgentInterface::protocol_version` field documentation updated to reference this constant.
- **ACP merger acknowledgement** — ACP (Agent Communication Protocol) merged into A2A under the Linux Foundation's Agentic AI Foundation (AAIF) in December 2025. The `brainwires-a2a` crate is compliant with A2A 0.3.0: all 11 JSON-RPC methods, all 9 task states, full security scheme support (PKCE, mTLS, OAuth2, OIDC), `/.well-known/agent-card.json` discovery endpoint, gRPC service, and REST router are implemented.

#### MCP 2026 Spec Compliance (`brainwires-mcp-server`, `brainwires-mcp`)

- **Streamable HTTP transport** (`brainwires-mcp-server`, feature `http`) — `HttpServerTransport` implements the MCP 2026 stateless HTTP transport: `POST /mcp` for JSON-RPC and `GET /mcp/events` SSE for server-initiated messages. Slots into the existing `ServerTransport` trait, wired with a bounded `mpsc` channel (`REQUEST_CHANNEL_CAPACITY = 128`), configurable request timeout (`REQUEST_TIMEOUT_SECS = 30`), and SSE keep-alive pings (`SSE_KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL_SECS = 15`).
- **MCP Server Cards** (SEP-1649) — `GET /.well-known/mcp/server-card.json` endpoint served by `HttpServerTransport`. Types: `McpServerCard`, `McpToolCardEntry`, `McpAuthInfo`, `McpTransportInfo`. Builder: `build_server_card()`. All re-exported from `brainwires-mcp-server`.
- **RFC9728 OAuth Protected Resource** — `GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` endpoint served by `HttpServerTransport`. `OAuthProtectedResource` type with `resource`, `authorization_servers`, `scopes_supported`, `bearer_methods_supported`.
- **OAuth 2.1 JWT validation middleware** (`brainwires-mcp-server`, feature `oauth`) — `OAuthMiddleware` validates `Authorization: Bearer` JWTs via HS256 (shared secret) or RS256 (RSA public key PEM). Configurable `iss`/`aud` claim enforcement. `initialize` method is always unauthenticated per MCP spec. Validated state is cached per-session in `RequestContext` metadata.
- **MCP Tasks primitive** (SEP-1686) — `McpTaskStore` thread-safe in-memory store with full 5-state lifecycle: `Working → Completed`, `Working → Failed`, `Working → Cancelled`, `Working ↔ InputRequired`. TTL-based expiry with `evict_expired()`. Typed accessors: `complete()`, `fail()`, `cancel()`, `update_state()`. `DEFAULT_MAX_RETRIES = 3`. Re-exported from `brainwires-mcp-server`.
- **HTTP client transport** (`brainwires-mcp`, feature `http`) — `HttpTransport` implements stateless JSON-RPC-over-HTTP: buffers requests in `send_request()`, POSTs to `{base_url}/mcp` in `receive_response()`/`receive_message()`. `Transport::Http(HttpTransport)` variant added. Re-exported as `brainwires_mcp::HttpTransport` (requires both `native` + `http` features).

#### Claude 4.6 + Context Compaction

- **Claude 4.6 model IDs** — Default models updated across the provider registry: Anthropic → `claude-sonnet-4-6`, Bedrock → `anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-6-v1:0`, VertexAI → `claude-sonnet-4-6`. OpenAI Responses API default updated to `gpt-5-mini`.
- **Context compaction handling** (`brainwires-core`, `brainwires-providers`, `brainwires-agents`) — New `StreamChunk::ContextCompacted { summary, tokens_freed }` variant. The Anthropic provider emits it when a `context_window_management_event` arrives mid-stream. `ChatAgent` handles it by replacing conversation history with the system prompt + a synthetic assistant summary message, with a `tracing::info!` log. All other streaming consumers (`brainwires-providers/brainwires_http`, `agent-chat`, `brainwires-cli`) handle the variant as a no-op.

#### EU AI Act Audit Logging (`brainwires-analytics`)

- **`ComplianceMetadata`** — New struct with `data_region`, `pii_present`, `retention_days`, `regulation`, `audit_required` fields. Added as `Option<ComplianceMetadata>` (`#[serde(default)]`) to `ProviderCall` and `AgentRun` event variants — fully backward-compatible with existing serialized events.
- **`AuditExporter`** — Time-range filtered export from `MemoryAnalyticsSink`: `export_json()` (JSON array), `export_csv()` (CSV with `event_type,session_id,timestamp,payload_json` columns), `apply_retention_policy(days)` (removes events older than N days, returns deleted count).
- **`PiiRedactionRules`** / `redact_event()`** — Configurable PII scrubbing: `hash_session_ids` (one-way `DefaultHasher` hash), `redact_prompt_content` (replaces `Custom` payload with `"[REDACTED]"`), `custom_patterns` (substring matching in string fields). `redact_event()` is pure — returns a new scrubbed event leaving the original intact.
- **`MemoryAnalyticsSink` helpers** — Added `deposit()` (sync record), `drain_matching(pred)` (filter-drain), `retain(pred)` (filter-in-place, returns removed count). `DEFAULT_CAPACITY = 1_000` constant re-exported from `brainwires_analytics`.

#### New Crates

- **`brainwires-system`** — Generic OS-level primitives extracted from `brainwires-autonomy`
  - `reactor` feature — cross-platform filesystem event watcher (`FsReactor`, `EventDebouncer`, `ReactorRule`) via `notify 7`
  - `services` feature — controlled systemd / Docker / process management (`SystemdManager`, `DockerManager`, `ProcessManager`, `ServiceSafety` with hardcoded critical-service deny-list)
  - Usable independently; no dependency on the autonomy crate

#### New Extras

- **`brainwires-scheduler`** — Local-machine MCP server for cron-based job scheduling with optional per-job Docker sandboxing
  - 9 MCP tools: `add_job`, `remove_job`, `list_jobs`, `get_job`, `enable_job`, `disable_job`, `run_job`, `get_logs`, `status`
  - Native and optional per-job Docker sandbox execution (`--memory`, `--cpus`, `--network=none`, volume mounts)
  - JSON-backed persistence at `~/.brainwires/scheduler/`; per-run log files with configurable retention (default: 20 per job)
  - Bounded concurrency via semaphore; `Ignore`/`Retry`/`Disable` failure policies; SIGTERM + Ctrl+C graceful shutdown with in-flight drain
  - stdio transport (primary, for Claude Code MCP integration) + optional HTTP via `--http <addr>`
  - 36 unit tests covering executor, store, daemon cron logic, and retry policy permutations

#### WebRTC Real-Time Media (`brainwires-channels`)

- **`webrtc` feature flag** — Full WebRTC peer connection support using the Brainwires fork of `webrtc-rs` (v0.20.0-alpha.1, trait-based async API). Zero impact on compile time or binary size without the feature.
- **`WebRtcSession`** — Manages a single `RTCPeerConnection` with full offer/answer state machine, trickle ICE, DTLS-SRTP, audio/video tracks, and DataChannels. All methods take `&self` for `Arc<WebRtcSession>` sharing across tasks.
  - `open()` / `close()` — create/tear down the underlying PeerConnection
  - `add_audio_track(AudioCodec)` / `add_video_track(VideoCodec)` — add local media before offer creation; returns an `AudioTrack`/`VideoTrack` handle for writing encoded frames
  - `create_offer()` / `create_answer()` / `set_remote_description()` — SDP negotiation
  - `add_ice_candidate()` / `restart_ice()` — trickle ICE and ICE restart
  - `create_data_channel(DataChannelConfig)` — open a WebRTC DataChannel
  - `get_remote_track(id)` — access incoming remote media tracks after `TrackAdded` event
  - `get_stats()` — full `RTCStatsReport` snapshot (jitter, packet loss, RTT, bitrate, jitter buffer, NACK counts, frame stats)
  - `subscribe()` — broadcast receiver for all session events
- **`webrtc-advanced` feature flag** — Adds congestion control and media quality interceptors on top of the default NACK/RTCP chain:
  - **GCC (Google Congestion Control)** — adaptive bitrate estimation from TWCC feedback; configure via `BandwidthConstraints` in `WebRtcConfig`; query via `session.target_bitrate_bps()`
  - **JitterBuffer** — adaptive playout delay, outermost in the receive chain
  - **TwccSender** — transport-wide sequence numbers for GCC feedback loop
  - A `tracing::warn!` is emitted at `open()` time when the feature is absent
- **`WebRtcConfig`** — Fully serde-serializable configuration:
  - `ice_servers` (STUN/TURN), `ice_transport_policy` (All / Relay)
  - `dtls_role` (Auto / Client / Server) — applied via `SettingEngine`
  - `mdns_enabled` — obfuscate LAN IPs with `.local` hostnames
  - `tcp_candidates_enabled` — gather TCP ICE candidates for firewall traversal
  - `bind_addresses` — restrict ICE gathering to specific interfaces (default: `0.0.0.0:0`)
  - `codec_preferences` (`VideoCodec` / `AudioCodec` enums) and `bandwidth` (`BandwidthConstraints`) for GCC
- **`WebRtcSignaling` trait** + two built-in impls:
  - `BroadcastSignaling` — in-process `tokio::broadcast` channel; used by the integration test and gateway intermediation
  - `ChannelMessageSignaling` — encodes SDP/ICE as JSON inside regular `ChannelMessage`s with metadata key `"_bw_webrtc_signaling"`; works through any existing adapter without changes
- **`WebRtcChannel` trait** — extension of `Channel` for adapters that support real-time media: `initiate_session()`, `get_session()`, `close_session()`, `signaling()`
- **`RemoteTrack`** — handle to an incoming remote media track; `poll() -> Option<TrackRemoteEvent>` for reading RTP packets and lifecycle events
- **`RTCStatsReport` / `StatsSelector`** re-exported from `brainwires_channels` root
- **10 new `ChannelEvent` variants** (all `#[cfg(feature = "webrtc")]`): `IceCandidate`, `SdpOffer`, `SdpAnswer`, `TrackAdded`, `TrackRemoved`, `WebRtcDataChannel`, `PeerConnectionStateChanged`, `IceConnectionStateChanged`, `IceGatheringComplete`, `SignalingStateChanged`
- **2 new `ChannelCapabilities` flags**: `DATA_CHANNELS` (bit 12), `ENCRYPTED_MEDIA` (bit 13)
- **Integration test** — `offer_answer_reaches_connected`: two in-process sessions complete a full offer/answer + trickle ICE exchange and both reach `PeerConnectionState::Connected` in ~1.3 s on loopback

### Changed

#### Autonomy (`brainwires-autonomy`)

- **`dream/` extracted → `brainwires-cognition`** (new `dream` feature) — memory consolidation belongs with the knowledge graph and RAG layer, not autonomous operations. Access via `brainwires_cognition::dream` or `brainwires::dream` (meta-crate `dream` feature).
- **`reactor/` + `services/` extracted → `brainwires-system`** — generic OS primitives are now independently usable without pulling in the full autonomy dependency tree. Access via `brainwires_system` or `brainwires::system`.
- **`scheduler/` removed** — superseded by `extras/brainwires-scheduler`, which provides the same functionality as a proper MCP server with a richer job model, persistence, and Docker sandboxing.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added

#### New Crates

- **`brainwires-analytics`** — Unified analytics collection, persistence, and querying for the framework. `AnalyticsCollector` multi-sink dispatcher with 10 typed event variants: `ProviderCall` (tokens, cost, latency), `AgentRun` (iterations, tool calls, total cost), `ToolCall`, `McpRequest`, `ChannelMessage`, `StorageOp`, `NetworkMessage`, `DreamCycle`, `AutonomySession`, and `Custom` (escape hatch). `AnalyticsLayer` — drop-in `tracing-subscriber` layer that automatically intercepts known span names (`provider.chat`, etc.) without modifying instrumented code. `MemoryAnalyticsSink` — in-process ring buffer. `SqliteAnalyticsSink` + `AnalyticsQuery` (feature `sqlite`) — local SQLite persistence and aggregated reporting: `cost_by_model()`, `tool_frequency()`, `daily_summary()`, `rebuild_summaries()`. All event types are fully serializable.

- **`brainwires-channels`** — Universal messaging channel contract for adapter implementations. Provides `Channel` trait (7 async methods), `ChannelMessage`, `ChannelEvent` (8 variants), `ChannelCapabilities` (12 bitflags), `ChannelUser`, `ChannelSession`, `ConversationId`, and `ChannelHandshake` protocol. Bidirectional conversion between `ChannelMessage` and agent-network `MessageEnvelope`.
- **`brainwires-mcp-server`** — MCP server framework extracted from `brainwires-agent-network`. Provides `McpServer`, `McpHandler` trait, `McpToolRegistry` (declarative tool registration + dispatch), `ServerTransport`/`StdioServerTransport`, and a composable middleware pipeline: `AuthMiddleware`, `LoggingMiddleware`, `RateLimitMiddleware`, `ToolFilterMiddleware`.

#### Agents (`brainwires-agents`)

- **`ChatAgent`** — Reusable streaming completion loop with per-user session management. Methods: `restore_messages()`, `compact_history()`.
- **Session persistence** — `SessionStore` trait + `JsonFileStore` implementation for persisting conversation history across restarts. Wired into BrainClaw via `memory.persist_conversations` config.

#### Tool System (`brainwires-tool-system`)

- **`BuiltinToolExecutor`** — Centralized dispatch executor for all built-in tools, eliminating duplication across agent implementations.
- **Email tools** (feature `email`) — IMAP/SMTP/Gmail read, send, search, and manage operations.
- **Calendar tools** (feature `calendar`) — Google Calendar/CalDAV event creation, listing, and update operations.

#### Code Interpreters (`brainwires-code-interpreters`)

- **Docker sandbox** — Container-isolated code execution via Docker; `Dockerfile.sandbox` at `crates/brainwires-code-interpreters/docker/`.

#### Skills (`brainwires-skills`)

- **`SkillPackage`** — Distributable skill package format with manifest, skill_content, SHA-256 checksum, and optional ed25519 signature.
- **`RegistryClient`** — HTTP client for publishing to and downloading from a skill registry server.
- **ed25519 signing** (feature `signing`) — Sign and verify skill packages for supply-chain safety.

#### Agent Networking (`brainwires-agent-network`)

- **Device allowlists** — `DeviceAllowlist`, `DeviceStatus` (Allowed/Blocked/Pending), `OrgPolicies`. Bridge computes a SHA-256 device fingerprint from machine-id + hostname + OS on every `Register` message; bails on `Blocked` status from server.
- **Sender verification** — Channel-type and channel-ID allowlists enforced at WebSocket handshake time; master `channels_enabled` switch.
- **Permission relay** — `PermissionRequest`/`PermissionResponse` message types. `PermissionRelay` module with pending request map (oneshot channels), session-allowed list, and configurable timeout. `RemoteBridge::send_permission_request()` sends a request and awaits approval; auto-denies on timeout.

#### Hardware (`brainwires-hardware`)

- **Voice Activity Detection** (always available with `audio`) — `VoiceActivityDetector` trait + `EnergyVad` (pure-Rust RMS energy threshold, no extra deps). Feature `vad` adds `WebRtcVad` (three aggressiveness modes: Quality, LowBitrate, Aggressive, VeryAggressive) via `webrtc-vad 0.4`. Helpers: `SpeechSegment`, `rms_db()`, `pcm_to_i16_mono()`, `pcm_to_f32()`.
- **Wake word detection** (feature `wake-word`) — `WakeWordDetector` trait + `WakeWordDetection` event. `EnergyTriggerDetector` — zero-dependency energy-burst trigger (fires when audio energy exceeds a dB threshold for N consecutive 30 ms frames). Optional `wake-word-rustpotter` feature adds `RustpotterDetector` (pure-Rust DTW/ONNX, `.rpw` model files). Optional `wake-word-porcupine` feature adds `PorcupineDetector` (Picovoice, builtin keywords + custom `.ppn` files).
- **Voice assistant pipeline** (feature `voice-assistant`) — `VoiceAssistant` orchestrates the full listen → wake word → VAD-gated capture → STT → handler → TTS → playback loop. `VoiceAssistantBuilder` for composing components. `VoiceAssistantHandler` async trait (`on_wake_word`, `on_speech`, `on_error`). `VoiceAssistantConfig` (silence threshold/duration, max record duration, listen timeout, STT/TTS options, device selection). `AssistantState` enum (Idle/Listening/Processing/Speaking). `listen_once()` for single-shot capture + transcription without handler callbacks.
- **Camera capture** (feature `camera`) — Cross-platform webcam/camera frame capture via `nokhwa` (V4L2 on Linux, AVFoundation on macOS, Media Foundation on Windows). `CameraCapture` async trait, `NokhwaCapture` impl with `spawn_blocking` bridge, `list_cameras()`, `open_camera(index, format)`, automatic MJPEG→RGB decoding. Types: `CameraDevice`, `CameraFrame`, `CameraFormat`, `Resolution`, `FrameRate`, `PixelFormat`, `CameraError`.
- **Raw USB access** (feature `usb`) — Device enumeration and async bulk/control/interrupt transfers via `nusb` (pure Rust, no libusb system dependency). `UsbHandle::open()` auto-discovers bulk endpoints from the interface descriptor. Types: `UsbDevice`, `UsbClass` (full USB-IF class code map), `UsbSpeed`, `UsbError`. `list_usb_devices()` reads string descriptors (manufacturer, product, serial) with graceful permission-error fallback.
- **`brainwires-hardware` renamed from `brainwires-audio`** — Unified hardware abstraction crate. GPIO moved from `brainwires-autonomy`; Bluetooth and Network hardware added. `brainwires-autonomy` re-exports GPIO via `pub use brainwires_hardware::gpio` for backward compatibility.
- **Deprecated `brainwires-audio`** — Stub crate at `deprecated/brainwires-audio`; re-exports `brainwires-hardware` with `audio` feature. Final release for ecosystem continuity.

#### Autonomy (`brainwires-autonomy`)

- **Autodream memory consolidation** (feature `dream`) — 4-phase consolidation cycle: orient → gather → consolidate → prune. Types: `DreamConsolidator`, `DemotionPolicy` (age/importance/budget thresholds), `DreamSummarizer` (LLM-powered compression), `FactExtractor` (5 categories: entities, relationships, events, preferences, habits), `DreamMetrics`, `DreamReport`, `DreamTask` (scheduled via `AutonomyScheduler`).

#### Cognition (`brainwires-cognition`)

- **Hindsight-inspired memory retrieval** — `detect_temporal_query()` scores temporal-intent keywords and dynamically boosts recency weighting in `search_adaptive_multi_factor()`. `CrossEncoderReranker` (implements `DiversityReranker`) blends retrieval scores with query-document cosine similarity via configurable `alpha`; `RerankerKind` supports `Spectral`, `CrossEncoder`, or `Both` (two-pass: diversity then relevance). `RagClient::query_ensemble()` fans out concurrently across `SearchStrategy` variants (`Semantic`, `Keyword`, `GitHistory`, `CodeNavigation`) and fuses results via RRF. `MemoryBankConfig` — mission, content-blocking directives, and five disposition traits (`Analytical`/`Concise`/`Cautious`/`Creative`/`Systematic`, each ±0.1 retrieval score bias) integrated into `BrainClient`. `MultiFactorScore` gains `compute_with_weights()` and `recency_from_hours_fast()`; `TieredMemoryConfig` gains `temporal_boost` and `fast_decay` fields.
- **Evidence tracking** — `Thought` gains `confidence`, `evidence_chain`, `reinforcement_count`, and `contradiction_count` fields. New `check_corroboration()` and `check_contradiction()` functions (negation-heuristic). `BrainClient` gains `apply_evidence_check()` and `replace_thought()`.
- **Mental models tier** — New `MentalModelStore`, `MentalModel`, and `ModelType` enum (`Behavioral`/`Structural`/`Causal`/`Procedural`). `MemoryTier::MentalModel` added at the lowest hierarchy level. `TieredMemory` gains `synthesize_mental_model()` (explicit only — never auto-populated) and `search_mental_models()`; results appended to `search_adaptive_multi_factor()`.

#### Autonomy / Agents — Empirical Evaluation (`brainwires-autonomy`, `brainwires-agents`, `brainwires-cognition`)

- **Empirical eval harness** (feature `eval-driven`) — Zero-network, <1 ms deterministic evaluation cases. Eight cases: `EntityImportanceRankingCase`, `EntitySingleMentionCase`, `EntityTypeBonusCase`, `MultiFactorRankingCase`, `TierDemotionCase`, `TaskBidScoringCase` (0.4×capability + 0.3×availability + 0.3×speed), `ResourceBidScoringCase` (0.7×priority + 0.3×bid), `ComplexityHeuristicCase` (keyword-based task complexity scoring). Suites: `entity_importance_suite()`, `multi_factor_suite()`. New `ranking_metrics` module: `ndcg_at_k()`, `mrr()`, `precision_at_k()` with graded relevance support.

#### Extras — Voice Assistant (`extras/voice-assistant/`)

- **`voice-assistant`** binary — Personal voice assistant built on the framework. Mic capture → optional energy wake trigger → VAD-gated speech accumulation → OpenAI Whisper STT → LLM response (OpenAI chat completions) → OpenAI TTS playback. CLI flags: `--config <path.toml>`, `--list-devices`, `--wake-word <model>`, `--verbose`. TOML config covers STT model, TTS voice, silence tuning, wake word model, LLM model/system prompt, and device names. Clean Ctrl-C shutdown via `tokio::signal`.

#### Extras — BrainClaw Suite (`extras/brainclaw/`)

- **`brainclaw`** (daemon) — Self-hosted personal AI assistant. Multi-provider support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, Ollama, Groq, Together, Fireworks, Bedrock, Vertex AI), per-user agent sessions, TOML config (`~/.brainclaw/brainclaw.toml`), native/email/calendar feature flags.
- **`brainwires-gateway`** — WebSocket/HTTP channel hub. `InboundHandler` trait for custom message processing; built-in `AgentInboundHandler` bridging channel events to `ChatAgent` sessions. WebChat browser UI at `/chat` with WebSocket at `/chat/ws`. Admin API (`/admin/*`) with Bearer token auth. Admin browser dashboard at `GET /admin/ui` (single-file dark-themed SPA; sections: Dashboard, Channels, Sessions, Cron Jobs, Identity, Broadcast). Webhook endpoint (`POST /webhook`) with HMAC-SHA256 verification. Media pipeline: attachment download, image description, audio transcription, size validation. Audit logger: structured JSON ring buffer via `tracing`. Metrics: atomic counters for messages, tool calls, errors, rate limits, spoofing blocks, and per-channel breakdowns. `/model` slash command for per-session model switching (`/model list`, `/model <name>`, `/model default`).
- **`brainwires-discord-channel`** — Discord bot adapter (serenity). Reference `Channel` trait implementation. Optional MCP tool server mode (`--mcp`).

#### Extras — Issue Tracker (`extras/brainwires-issues/`)

- **`brainwires-issues`** — Lightweight MCP-native issue tracking server inspired by Linear's agent interface. Serves 10 tools: `create_issue`, `get_issue` (accepts UUID or `#number`), `list_issues` (filters: project, status, assignee, label; offset-based pagination), `update_issue`, `close_issue`, `delete_issue` (optional cascade), `search_issues` (BM25 full-text with in-memory fallback), `add_comment`, `list_comments` (offset pagination), `delete_comment`. Four prompts: `/create`, `/list`, `/search`, `/triage`. Data model: `Issue` with UUID, auto-incrementing display number, title, description, status (Backlog/Todo/InProgress/InReview/Done/Cancelled), priority (NoPriority/Low/Medium/High/Urgent), labels (Vec<String>), assignee, project, parent_id for sub-issues, created/updated/closed timestamps. Comments with author and body. LanceDB backend at `<data_dir>/brainwires-issues/lancedb/`; BM25 full-text index at `<data_dir>/brainwires-issues/bm25/`.

#### Extras — brainwires-cli (`extras/brainwires-cli/`)

- **`brainwires-cli`** migrated into monorepo — The flagship AI-powered agentic CLI (76k lines) moved from a standalone repository with a framework git submodule into `extras/brainwires-cli/` as a root workspace member. Eliminates the two-repo submodule workflow; CI now covers CLI and framework changes together. `agent-chat` remains as the minimal reference implementation.

#### Core Types (`brainwires-core`)

- **`ChatOptions::model`** — New `model: Option<String>` field. When `Some`, all providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenAI Responses, Gemini, Ollama, and OpenAI-compatible) substitute this model for their configured default on that request. Enables per-request and per-session model switching without recreating the provider. `ChatOptions` gains a `.model()` builder method.

### Fixed

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)

- **LanceDB 0.27 upgrade** — Bumped `lancedb` from 0.26 to 0.27. Fixed `Scannable` API breaking change: `create_table()` and `add()` now require `T: Scannable`; cast `RecordBatchIterator` to `Box<dyn RecordBatchReader + Send>` at all callsites.
- **SQL injection prevention** — `filter_to_sql()` now backtick-quotes all column names, preventing column identifiers from being misinterpreted as SQL keywords or operators. Three `LanceDatabase` callsites that interpolated user-controlled `project_name` and `root_path` values directly into SQL filter strings have been replaced with typed `Filter::Eq` expressions.
- **BM25 parse errors logged** — `parse_query_lenient()` errors were silently discarded; now logged via `tracing::warn!` so dropped search terms are visible.
- **BM25 schema drift recovery** — Opening an existing BM25 index now validates that all required fields (`id`, `content`, `file_path`) exist. On mismatch (e.g. after a schema change between versions) the stale index is deleted and rebuilt automatically.
- **BM25 silent document loss fixed** — Documents with a missing or corrupt `id` field are now logged (`tracing::warn!`) instead of silently skipped, making index corruption visible.
- **BM25 `STORED` flag added to `content` field** — The `content` field was indexed as `TEXT` only; adding `STORED` allows document content to be retrieved after indexing. Existing indexes are rebuilt automatically via the schema drift check above.

#### Facade (`brainwires`)

- Removed `brainwires-proxy` from the `full` feature flag. Extras are consumers of the framework, not framework dependencies; external consumers (such as `brainwires-cli`) do not have extras in their workspace. The `proxy` feature remains available as an explicit opt-in.

#### Providers (`brainwires-providers`)

- **llama-cpp-2 token API** — Replaced deprecated `token_to_str` with `token_to_piece` to restore compatibility with llama-cpp-2 ≥ 0.9.

#### Analytics (`brainwires-analytics`)

- **Runtime path coverage** — Analytics events wired into all remaining framework paths (Phases 7–9): per-iteration agent events, tool call tracking, MCP request events, and storage operation events.

### Quality

- **Test coverage expansion** — Added ~440 tests across 14 previously untested or undertested crates and extras. Coverage: A2A protocol serialization roundtrips; analytics event construction; brainwires-issues CRUD + BM25 search + pagination; mcp-matrix, mcp-whatsapp, mcp-mattermost, and mcp-signal config serde + protocol parsing + envelope helpers; hardware VAD, Bluetooth, GPIO, and network types via a mock backend; autonomy git workflows, merge policies, and webhook HMAC signatures; mcp-server middleware (auth, rate limiting, logging, connection context); storage BM25/RRF ranking correctness with tempdir-isolated indexes; provider trait contract via a zero-network `MockProvider` integration suite; audio-demo-ffi FFI type conversion roundtrips.

### Refactored

- **Deprecated mesh submodules removed** (`brainwires-agent-network`) — `mesh::discovery`, `mesh::error`, `mesh::node`, and `mesh::routing` deleted. `mesh::federation` and `mesh::topology` updated to use the canonical replacements: `AgentIdentity` (was `MeshNode`) and `NetworkError` (was `MeshError`). Only `FederationGateway`, `FederationPolicy`, `MeshTopology`, and `TopologyType` are now exported from `mesh::*`.

- **BrainClaw workspace** — BrainClaw is now a self-contained Cargo workspace at `extras/brainclaw/`, excluded from the root workspace via `[workspace].exclude`. Members use path dependencies back to `crates/` for framework libraries.
- **Docker Dockerfile** — Moved `extras/docker/Dockerfile.sandbox` to `crates/brainwires-code-interpreters/docker/` where it belongs alongside the crate it supports.
- **`brainwires-mcp-server` extracted** — MCP server framework code was split out of `brainwires-agent-network` into its own publishable crate. `brainwires-agent-network` now depends on `brainwires-mcp-server`; consumers that only need to build MCP servers no longer need to pull in the full networking stack.
- **`brainwires-channels` optional dep** — `brainwires-channels`' dependency on `brainwires-agent-network` is now optional, gated behind the `agent-network` feature flag (conversion module).

## [0.6.0] - 2026-03-23

### Changed

#### A2A Protocol (`brainwires-a2a`, `deno/a2a`)
- **BREAKING:** Updated A2A protocol implementation from v0.3 to v1.0.
- **Part type redesigned:** Replaced discriminated union (`kind: text/file/data`) with unified flat struct (`text`/`raw`/`url`/`data` as optional oneof fields + `mediaType`, `filename`).
- **Enum values → SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE:** Role (`ROLE_USER`, `ROLE_AGENT`), TaskState (`TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED`, `TASK_STATE_WORKING`, etc.) per ProtoJSON specification.
- **Removed `kind` field** from `Message`, `Task`, and streaming event objects.
- **Stream events use wrapper pattern:** `StreamResponse` with `task`/`message`/`statusUpdate`/`artifactUpdate` wrapper fields instead of `kind`-based discrimination.
- **SecurityScheme and OAuthFlows** changed from `type`-discriminated to wrapper-based oneOf pattern.
- **JSON-RPC method names** updated to PascalCase (`message/send` → `SendMessage`, etc.).
- **REST:** `GET /tasks/{id}:subscribe` changed to `POST`.
- **`SendMessageConfiguration.blocking`** renamed to `returnImmediately`.
- **`PushNotificationConfig.id`** renamed to `configId`, added `createdAt`.
- **`AgentCard.supportedInterfaces`** is now required.

#### Code Interpreters (`brainwires-code-interpreters`)
- Disabled Python/RustPython feature to resolve `libsqlite3-sys` version conflict with `brainwires-cognition`.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-15

### Added

#### Autonomy (`brainwires-autonomy`)
- **Crash recovery** (feature `crash-handler`): Detect crashed processes → AI-powered diagnostics → automatic fix → rebuild → relaunch. Persistent recovery state tracking across restarts.
- **CI/CD orchestrator** (feature `cicd`): GitHub Issues → investigate → fix → PR → merge pipeline. Webhook config, variable interpolation, event logging.
- **Cron scheduler** (feature `scheduler`): Recurring autonomous tasks with cron-expression triggers and configurable failure policies (retry, skip, abort).
- **File system reactor** (feature `reactor`): Watch directories with glob-based rules, debounced event dispatch, and rate limiting.
- **Service management** (feature `services`): Manage systemd units, Docker containers, and OS processes with hardcoded deny-list safety and allow-list enforcement.
- **GPIO hardware control** (feature `gpio`): Pin manager with allow-list policies, PWM configuration, and auto-release timeouts.
- 117 tests across all 6 new features; each feature flag compiles independently.

#### Examples
- **16 examples across 9 crates**: permissions (`policy_engine`, `trust_audit`), MDAP (`voting_consensus`, `task_decomposition`), skills (`skill_registry`), code-interpreters (`multi_language`), A2A (`agent_card`), cognition (`prompting_techniques`), autonomy (`safety_guard`), agent-network (`middleware_chain`), and 6 agent coordination patterns (`contract_net`, `saga_compensation`, `task_queue_scheduling`, `optimistic_concurrency`, `three_state_model`, `validation_loop`).
- **10 examples for brainwires-autonomy**: `health_monitor`, `session_metrics`, `crash_recovery`, `self_improve_strategies`, `git_workflow_pipeline`, `cicd_orchestrator`, `cron_scheduler`, `fs_reactor`, `service_manager`, `gpio_pins`.

#### Documentation
- **BYO database guide** (`databases/README.md`): Step-by-step guide for implementing custom `StorageBackend` and `VectorDatabase` backends, with trait method documentation and integration patterns.

#### Crate Merges (19 → 18 crates)
- **`brainwires-mdap`** merged into `brainwires-agents` behind the `mdap` feature flag. The standalone `brainwires-mdap` crate is now deprecated; use `brainwires-agents = { version = "0.5", features = ["mdap"] }` instead.

#### Build & CI (`xtask`)
- **`package-count` command**: `cargo xtask package-count [--dry-run]` counts workspace members (crates vs extras) and updates stale count references in `.md` files. Skips CHANGELOG.md, deprecated directories, code blocks, and historical arrow lines.
- **Deprecated crate publishing**: `publish.sh` now publishes deprecated stub crates (e.g. `brainwires-mdap`) after all workspace crates, with non-fatal error handling.

#### Testing
- **472 integration tests across 6 crates**: agent-network (47), agents (53), audio (93), code-interpreters (142), skills (82), wasm (55).

#### Code Quality
- Resolved all 16 `check-stubs` false-positive warnings by rewording doc comments and adding `todo_scanner.rs` to the skip list.

### Changed

#### Providers (`brainwires-providers`)
- Updated default models: Anthropic now defaults to latest Claude model, OpenAI to latest GPT model.

#### Build & Publishing
- `publish.sh` enhanced with smarter version tagging logic to handle patch bumps correctly.
- Version replacement logic improved to handle doc comments in Rust files.
- README version example updated to 0.4.

#### Documentation
- `brainwires-autonomy` README rewritten with new features, feature flags, examples, and safety documentation.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-15

### Added

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- **`PostgresDatabase` StorageBackend impl** (1900+ lines across all 3 backends):
  - `FieldValue`→`ToSql` type conversion for all 9 field types (including `pgvector::Vector` for embedding columns).
  - `vector_search` via pgvector `<=>` (cosine distance) operator with parameterized SQL.
  - `row_to_record` parser using `tokio_postgres` column type metadata (`Type::TEXT`, `Type::INT4`, `Type::FLOAT8`, `Type::BOOL`, etc.) with automatic pgvector detection for unknown types.
  - Helper functions `field_values_to_params` and `params_as_refs` for ergonomic boxed `ToSql` parameter handling.
  - Full `create_table`, `insert`, `query`, `update`, `delete`, `vector_search` implementations via the shared `PostgresDialect` SQL generator.
- **`MySqlDatabase` backend** via `mysql_async` (~490 lines):
  - Full `StorageBackend` implementation with connection pooling (`mysql_async::Pool`).
  - Connectivity verification on construction (ping + disconnect handshake).
  - Vector columns stored as JSON arrays; `vector_search` performs client-side cosine similarity since MySQL lacks native vector types.
  - SQL generation via the shared `MySqlDialect`.
  - New `mysql-backend` feature flag with `mysql_async` dependency.
- **`SurrealDatabase` backend** via `surrealdb` 2.x SDK (~1160 lines):
  - Both `StorageBackend` and `VectorDatabase` trait implementations.
  - Native MTREE KNN vector search with cosine distance using SurrealDB's vector indexing.
  - `with_config()` constructor for explicit credentials; default `new()` uses `root`/`root`.
  - Client-side BM25 scoring for hybrid (vector + keyword) queries via shared `bm25_helpers`.
  - Glob-based file path filtering via shared `glob_utils`.
  - `DatabaseStats`, `ChunkMetadata`, and `SearchResult` type support for full RAG compatibility.
  - New `surrealdb-backend` feature flag with `surrealdb` dependency.

#### Build & CI (`xtask`)
- **Smart version bumping**: Full workspace-aware version bump system with:
  - `--crates` flag parsing and bump mode detection (full vs patch).
  - Workspace dependency graph construction and cascade logic (bumping a crate also bumps its dependents).
  - Auto-detection of changed crates from `git diff` for selective patch-mode bumping.
  - Reset of explicit version overrides on minor/major bumps.
  - Selective patch-mode version bumping for targeted releases.
  - Wired up full + patch mode execution paths.
- **`check-stubs` command**: Scans all `.rs` files for hard blockers (`todo!()`, `unimplemented!()`) and soft markers (`FIXME`, `HACK`, `XXX`, `STUB`, `STOPSHIP`, `"not implemented"`). Skips test code, uses word-boundary detection to avoid false positives. Supports `--strict` (markers = errors) and `--verbose` flags.
- **CHANGELOG stamping**: `bump-version` now renames `## [Unreleased]` to `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD` and inserts a fresh empty `## [Unreleased]` section above it.

### Removed

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- Removed `MySqlDatabase` and `SurrealDatabase` stub backends (contained `todo!()` placeholders), replaced by real implementations (see Added above).
- SQL dialect files (`sql/mysql.rs`, `sql/surrealdb.rs`) retained for future use.

### Changed

- Added `surrealdb` (feature `surrealdb-backend`) for SurrealDB 2.x SDK integration.

#### Documentation
- Updated `PUBLISHING.md` with smart version bump instructions and `check-stubs` checklist wording.

#### Code Quality
- Applied formatting improvements across the workspace for consistency and readability.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-14

### Breaking Changes

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- **Unified database layer**: Merged `clients/` (7 VectorDatabase impls) and `stores/backends/` (StorageBackend impl) into a single `databases/` module. One struct per database, one shared connection, implementing `StorageBackend` and/or `VectorDatabase`.
- Removed `clients/` module entirely — all database implementations now live in `databases/<name>/`.
- Removed `stores/backend.rs`, `stores/backends/`, `stores/lance_client.rs` — merged into `databases/lance/`.
- Renamed all database structs: `LanceVectorDB` → `LanceDatabase`, `QdrantVectorDB` → `QdrantDatabase`, `PostgresVectorDB` → `PostgresDatabase`, `PineconeVectorDB` → `PineconeDatabase`, `MilvusVectorDB` → `MilvusDatabase`, `WeaviateVectorDB` → `WeaviateDatabase`, `NornicVectorDB` → `NornicDatabase`.
- `LanceBackend` merged into `LanceDatabase` — implements both `StorageBackend` and `VectorDatabase` on a single `lancedb::Connection`.
- PostgreSQL backend switched from `sqlx` to `tokio-postgres` + `deadpool-postgres` to avoid `libsqlite3-sys` version conflict with `rusqlite`.

#### Cognition (`brainwires-cognition`)
- `RagClient` now stores `Arc<dyn VectorDatabase>` instead of concrete database types. Added `with_vector_db()` constructor for external injection.
- `BrainClient` rewritten to use `Arc<dyn StorageBackend>` instead of raw LanceDB/arrow APIs. Added `with_backend()` constructor.
- `u64` fields in PKS/BKS cache now cast through `i64` for `rusqlite` 0.38 compatibility.

### Added

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- **`databases/` module** — unified database layer with:
  - `traits.rs`: `StorageBackend` + `VectorDatabase` traits (always available, no feature gate)
  - `types.rs`: `FieldDef`, `FieldType`, `FieldValue`, `Record`, `ScoredRecord`, `Filter` types
  - `capabilities.rs`: `BackendCapabilities` struct for runtime feature detection
  - `sql/`: Shared SQL generation layer with `SqlDialect` trait + `PostgresDialect`, `MySqlDialect`, `SurrealDialect` implementations
  - `lance/`: `LanceDatabase` (both traits, embedded LanceDB)
  - `postgres/`: `PostgresDatabase` (VectorDatabase, via tokio-postgres + pgvector)
  - `qdrant/`: `QdrantDatabase` (VectorDatabase)

- New feature flags: `postgres-backend` (alongside existing `lance-backend`, `qdrant-backend`, `pinecone-backend`, `weaviate-backend`, `milvus-backend`, `nornicdb-*`).
- `async-trait` is now a required (non-optional) dependency — core traits are always available regardless of feature flags.
- 112 tests: 18 SQL dialect tests, Lance CRUD/vector-search/capabilities/shared-connection tests, 2 integration tests (trait object CRUD, backend capabilities).

#### Cognition (`brainwires-cognition`)
- `RagClient::with_vector_db()` — construct with any `Arc<dyn VectorDatabase>` for backend-agnostic RAG.
- `BrainClient::with_backend()` — construct with any `Arc<dyn StorageBackend>` for backend-agnostic knowledge storage.

### Changed

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- Domain stores (`MessageStore`, `ConversationStore`, `TaskStore`, `PlanStore`, `SummaryStore`, `FactStore`, `ImageStore`, `TierMetadataStore`, `AgentStateStore`) now default to `LanceDatabase` instead of the removed `LanceBackend`.
- `PersistentTaskManager` and `TieredMemory` updated to use `LanceDatabase`.
- README rewritten with unified database backends section, trait implementation matrix, connection sharing examples, and feature flag reference.
- Module-level and crate-level documentation updated to reflect new architecture.

#### Dependencies
- Replaced `sqlx` with `tokio-postgres` 0.7 + `deadpool-postgres` 0.14 for PostgreSQL backend (eliminates `libsqlite3-sys` conflict).
- `pgvector` features changed from `["sqlx"]` to `["postgres"]`.
- Removed unused `sqlx-sqlite` patch from workspace `[patch.crates-io]`.

- `stores/lance_client.rs` — legacy `LanceClient` replaced by `LanceDatabase`.

---

### Added

#### Agent Network (`brainwires-agent-network`)
- **5-layer protocol stack** for pluggable agent networking: Identity → Transport → Routing → Discovery → Application.
- **Identity layer**: `AgentIdentity`, `AgentCard` (capabilities, protocols, metadata, endpoint), `ProtocolId`, `SigningKey`/`VerifyingKey` (ChaCha20-Poly1305 with SHA-256 key derivation).
- **Transport layer**: `Transport` trait with 5 implementations:
  - `IpcTransport` (feature `ipc-transport`) — Unix-socket with optional ChaCha20-Poly1305 encryption.

- **Discovery layer**: `Discovery` trait with `ManualDiscovery` (in-memory) and `RegistryDiscovery` (HTTP REST, feature `registry-discovery`).
- **Application layer**: `NetworkManager` and `NetworkManagerBuilder` tying all layers together with `send()`, `broadcast()`, and event subscription.
- Core network types: `MessageEnvelope`, `MessageTarget` (Direct/Broadcast/Topic), `Payload` (Json/Binary/Text), `NetworkEvent`, `NetworkError`, `TransportType`, `ConnectionState`.
- New feature flags: `ipc-transport` (default), `remote-transport` (default), `tcp-transport`, `pubsub-transport`, `a2a-transport`, `mesh` (includes `tcp-transport`), `registry-discovery`, `full`.
- 74 new tests across all protocol stack layers.

### Changed

#### Agent Network (`brainwires-agent-network`)
- Renamed `src/transport.rs` (MCP-specific `ServerTransport`) to `src/mcp_transport.rs` to avoid conflict with the new `transport/` module. `ServerTransport` and `StdioServerTransport` are still re-exported from the crate root.
- Updated `mesh/` module with deprecation notices pointing to the new protocol-layer equivalents.
- Default features now include `ipc-transport` and `remote-transport`.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-03-12

### Breaking Changes

- Fixed import paths across all crates affected by feature flag removal.

### Added

#### Cognition (`brainwires-cognition`)
- New unified intelligence crate combining knowledge graphs, adaptive prompting, RAG, spectral math, and code analysis.
- **Knowledge subsystem** (from `brainwires-brain`): `BrainClient`, thought capture, PKS/BKS, entity graphs, semantic memory search.
- **Prompting subsystem** (from `brainwires-prompting`): 15 techniques in 4 categories, task clustering, temperature optimization, learning coordinator.
- **RAG subsystem** (from `brainwires-rag`): `RagClient`, codebase indexing, AST-aware chunking, hybrid vector + BM25 search, git history search, code navigation.
- **Spectral subsystem**: MSS-inspired spectral subset selection for diverse RAG retrieval using log-determinant diversity scoring.
- **Spectral graph operations** (`spectral::graph_ops`): Laplacian construction, Fiedler vector via inverse power iteration, spectral clustering (recursive bisection), algebraic connectivity, effective resistance, Spielman-Srivastava-inspired sparsification, and spectral centrality/bisection — extends spectral methods beyond RAG to general graph analysis.
- **Spectral methods on `RelationshipGraph`**: `spectral_clusters(k)` for semantic community detection within connected components, `spectral_central_nodes(limit)` for structural bridge-node identification, `connectivity()` for graph health monitoring via algebraic connectivity, and `sparsify(epsilon)` for pruning redundant edges while preserving spectral properties. All feature-gated under `spectral`.
- Feature flags: `knowledge` (default), `prompting` (default), `rag`, `spectral`, `code-analysis`, `tree-sitter-languages`, `native` (everything), `wasm`.

#### Agents (`brainwires-agents`)
- **Planner-Worker-Judge cycle orchestration**: Plan→Work→Judge loop for scaling multi-agent coding tasks, inspired by Cursor's planner-worker pipeline pattern. Each cycle: a `PlannerAgent` explores the codebase and creates dynamic tasks, workers execute them via `TaskOrchestrator` with dependency-aware scheduling, and a `JudgeAgent` evaluates results with structured verdicts (Complete, Continue, FreshRestart, Abort).
  - `planner_agent`: LLM-powered dynamic task planner with JSON output parsing, sub-planner recursion, and cycle detection on the task graph.
  - `judge_agent`: LLM-powered cycle evaluator with structured verdict types.
  - `cycle_orchestrator`: Full Plan→Work→Judge loop with fresh `TaskManager` per cycle, configurable `max_cycles`/`max_workers`, and worktree integration prep.
  - New system prompts: `planner_agent_prompt()` and `judge_agent_prompt()`.
  - `spawn_agent_with_context()` on agent pool for per-worker custom `AgentContext`.
  - New communication messages: `CycleStarted`, `CycleCompleted`, `PlanCreated`, `WorkerBranchMerged`.
- **SEAL integration**: Moved `brainwires-seal` into `brainwires-agents/seal/` as a feature-gated module.
  - Feature flags: `seal`, `seal-mdap`, `seal-knowledge`, `seal-feedback`.
  - `SealKnowledgeCoordinator` now integrates with `brainwires-cognition` instead of `brainwires-brain`.
- 4 standalone examples added for agent usage patterns.

#### Agent Network (`brainwires-agent-network`)
- New crate formed by merging `brainwires-relay` (MCP server framework, encrypted IPC, remote bridge) and `brainwires-mesh` (distributed mesh networking).
- Feature flags: `server` (default), `client` (default), `mesh`, `auth-keyring`.

#### Storage (`brainwires-storage`)
- New `vector-db` feature: vector database trait + backends (LanceDB, Qdrant), BM25 keyword search, glob/path utilities — used by `brainwires-cognition` RAG subsystem.
- Removed `agents` feature and `PersistentTaskManager` (decoupled from agents layer).

#### Build & CI
- `xtask ci` command for local CI: runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy`, and `cargo test` in a single command via the xtask pattern (`cargo xtask ci`). Added `.cargo/config.toml` alias and updated `CONTRIBUTING.md` with usage instructions.

#### Licensing
- Added Apache 2.0 and MIT license files to all crates for compliance and distribution.

### Changed

#### Framework-wide
- Reduced crate count from 23 to 19 through strategic merges (see Breaking Changes above).

- Updated all README files to reflect post-merge crate structure and integrated documentation from dissolved crates.
- Updated workspace dependency tree in `crates/README.md`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-03-09

### Changed

- Removed hardcoded crate counts from `CONTRIBUTING.md` and `crates/README.md` to avoid staleness.
- Replaced inline crate listing in `CONTRIBUTING.md` with links to `README.md`, `crates/README.md`, and `extras/README.md`.
- Removed extras table from `crates/README.md`; extras are now documented in their own `extras/README.md`.
- Applied `cargo fmt --all` across workspace.

### Added

#### SEAL (`brainwires-seal`)
- **Feedback Bridge** (`feedback_bridge.rs`): New module that wires `AuditLogger` user feedback (thumbs-up/down + corrections) into the SEAL learning loop. `FeedbackBridge` pulls `FeedbackSignal` events on demand and converts them into `LearningCoordinator` outcomes and `PatternHint` entries in global memory.
- New `feedback` feature gate (`dep:brainwires-permissions`, `dep:tokio`) keeps the `AuditLogger` dependency optional.
- 7 unit tests covering per-run processing, recent-feedback queries, correction application, and run isolation.

#### Facade (`brainwires`)
- `learning` convenience feature now includes `permissions` and `brainwires-seal/feedback`, completing the full feedback loop: `AuditLogger → FeedbackBridge → LearningCoordinator → BKS promotion`.

### Changed

#### Framework-wide
- **MSRV bumped from 1.88 to 1.91** — required by updated AWS SDK dependencies (`aws-config`, `aws-sigv4`, `aws-smithy-*`, etc.).
- Updated CI toolchain from Rust 1.88 to 1.91 across all 5 GitHub Actions jobs.
- Added `protoc` installation step to CI (required by `lance-encoding` build dependency).
- Applied `cargo fmt --all` across workspace.

#### Dependencies
- **rmcp** 0.8 → 1.1 (non-exhaustive structs, renamed features/types)
- **tokio-tungstenite** 0.21 → 0.26 (`Message::Text` now wraps `Utf8Bytes`)
- **rand** 0.8 → 0.10 (`thread_rng` → `rng`, `RngCore` → `Rng`, `gen_range` → `random_range`)
- **bincode** 1 → 2 (new serde encode/decode API)
- **serde_yaml** → **serde_yml** 0.0.12 (crate rename)
- **tonic** 0.12 → 0.13, **prost** 0.13 → 0.14 (removed `async_trait` macro)

- **toml** 0.8 → 1.0, **git2** 0.19 → 0.20, **lru** 0.12 → 0.16
- **boa_engine** 0.20 → 0.21, **tokenizers** 0.21 → 0.22, **tiktoken-rs** 0.7 → 0.9

### Fixed
- Fixed invalid crates.io category slug (`science::ml` → `artificial-intelligence`) on `brainwires-training`.
- Updated publish script rate limits for existing-crate version publishes (burst 30, then 1/min).

### Changed
- Upgraded `#![warn(missing_docs)]` to `#![deny(missing_docs)]` across all 22 crates
- Added doc comments to all previously undocumented public items (~155 warnings resolved)

### Refactored
- Renamed `brainwires-model-tools` to `brainwires-tool-system` to better reflect the crate's scope (registry, execution, built-in implementations, error taxonomy, sanitization, orchestration, code execution, semantic search, OpenAPI generation, smart routing).

#### Agents (`brainwires-agents`)
- Replaced `panic!()`/`unwrap()` in eval suite with graceful `TrialResult::failure` conversions.
- Implemented `TextMerge` (line-by-line dedup) and `JsonMerge` (recursive deep merge) optimistic concurrency strategies.
- Replaced silent `let _ =` broadcast/send drops with `tracing::warn` logging across contract_net, task_orchestrator, and validator_agent.

#### Providers (`brainwires-providers`)
- Refactored monolithic `openai_responses/mod.rs` into structured modules (`client.rs`, `convert.rs`, `provider.rs`, `types/`).
- 54 new tests covering serde round-trips for all wire types.

#### Training (`brainwires-training`)
- Upgraded Burn from 0.16 to 0.20. Switched from umbrella `burn` crate to individual crates (`burn-core`, `burn-nn`, `burn-optim`, `burn-autodiff`, `burn-wgpu`, `burn-ndarray`) to avoid `cubecl-cpu` links="lzma" conflict with `xz2` from datafusion/lancedb.
- Fixed `squeeze`/`unsqueeze` API calls for Burn 0.19+ compatibility.
- Added `extern crate burn_core as burn` shim for derive macro resolution.
- Cloud providers (Together, Fireworks, Anyscale): extracted `extract_error()` and `parse_job_status()` helpers; `list_jobs()` now parses actual job status instead of hardcoding `Pending`.
- Cloud providers (Bedrock, Vertex): all methods now return explicit `TrainingError::NotImplemented` errors instead of ad-hoc strings.

#### Framework-wide
- Production-readiness audit across 15 crates (40 files): replaced 121 `unwrap()` calls with `context()`/`expect()`/`LazyLock`; fixed 10 clippy warnings; removed 3 deprecated zero-caller functions; removed 3 dead code items; resolved 2 TODO comments.

### Fixed

#### A2A (`brainwires-a2a`)
- Capped SSE stream buffers at 16MB to prevent unbounded memory growth.
- Added bearer token auth on all transports.
- Fixed gRPC error code mapping, mutex for streaming, and bind error propagation.
- Added CORS headers, resilient accept loop, and graceful shutdown.
- Incremental SSE parser with multi-line data support.

#### Hardware (`brainwires-hardware`)
- Proper error handling for non-UTF-8 model paths in `WhisperStt`.

#### RAG (`brainwires-rag`)
- Fixed use-after-move of `symbol_name` in `find_references`.
- Git search results now return the actual commit date instead of hardcoded `0`.
- Dirty flag is now cleared immediately after embeddings + cache are flushed to disk in both full and incremental indexing paths.
